Beck's Old Shanghai-An original interpretation & music video for Beck's: Song Reader project 

[https://youtu.be/\_Xg-KLCdEms][0]

For [Beck's: Song Reader][1] project he decided to release the entire album as sheet music only.

So cool! I thought it would be awesome to create a crazy fun collaborative piece.

I partnered with world-renowned classical pianist & composer Robert DeGaetano, [Gabe Askew][2] - the media artist (animator/director) extraordinaire and my purpose driven branding agency, [The Humans][3].

Robert has written/recorded a custom interpretation of one of Beck's sheet music songs and Gabe has contributed a gorgeous piece of animation. I produced and edited the project.
