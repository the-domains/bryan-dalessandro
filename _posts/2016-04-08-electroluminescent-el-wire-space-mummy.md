On my third trip to Burning Man I decided it was time to try my hand at EL wire. Really fantastic material.

\*EL wire, or electroluminescent wire is phosphorus covered copper wire wrapped in colored tubing which effectively works as flexible neon. The cool thing is that you can set it up on a sequencer that uses multiple channels to work like an animation. Being it was my first time working with it I figured I might as well pull out the stops.

200' of wire later, 3 colors, 6 channels, many yards of torn linen, Space Mummy rose to life.

Ambitious? Sure. Ballsy? Probably. Stupid? Absolutely.
