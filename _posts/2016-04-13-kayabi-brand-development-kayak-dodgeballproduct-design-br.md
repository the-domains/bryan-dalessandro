NY Kayak Company came to us with a truly awesome challenge... to package and develop a soup to nuts brand identity for a new sport. Kayak dodgeball.

Branding as a team sport.

By alpha testing the sport and crowd sourcing the name and brand voice from the participants we were able to capture the spirit of the game in time and develop a full brand identity in time for the upcoming season.
