Full Circle: Packaging & Icons

Full Circle is an incredible brand designing intentional products that provide moments of satisfaction for their customers. This is accomplished through intuitive and sexy product design with materials that are innovative and sustainable. 

PACKAGING:

Full Circle came to us for a pack redesign, we gave them a complete overhaul of the brand. We started from the Brand Foundation connecting the founders back with their passion and purpose and began to uncover the brand personality developing an informed, conscious, and saucy voice. 

We carried through this clarity all the way through to information architecture to house and communicate consistently across the brand's 50+ products. For the packaging design we decided it was only right to let the product take center stage. We treated the packaging much like a museum that is thoughtful and instructive, yet it disappears from site. This also allowed for a much higher visibility on crowded store shelves.

PACKAGING ICON SET

FULL CIRCLE was faced with the challenge of breaking out of the clutter in over saturated stores. All of this while communicating the better choice they offer through their values driven choices in materials and production. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/02ec6592-5902-4f14-9a74-4fffc94db842.png)

The second set of icons is used on back of pack to communicate a deeper look at their approach, benefit, and use and care.
