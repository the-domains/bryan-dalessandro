CREO Smartglass: Product Development + Package Design

* Creo is a new high-end cooking prep and presentation brand. Their sole mission is to elevate the food experience. Their innovative smart glass technology is designed to be a beautiful standout on the table and is safe to use in the freezer, oven and dishwasher. 

With such an advanced product they hired us to make sure it looked the part. We stepped in at the prototyping process guiding design and color selection.

**DESIGN & COLOR:**

We designed two lines of Smartglass bakeware and nesting bowls for Creo:

**1\. **The **GREY MATTERS** line hit the urban dwellers demo like a straight double shot of Stumptown Espresso. This matte grey collection with white pop interior says it all without even trying.

**2\.** The **POP** line aimed to appeal to modern foodies that make the kitchen the centerpiece of their home by creating accent pieces they'd proudly display on the shelf and the table.

**PACKAGING:**

Of course these products needed a package to fit their style. We kept it clean and simple- allowing the product to do all of the talking luring in passerby's by appealing to their best nature, their taste. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e80b2e69-884c-4666-963b-a8be22059c0b.jpg)
